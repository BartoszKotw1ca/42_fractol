## Motivation and Purpose
- **Motivation:** The motivation behind this project was to explore the fascinating world of fractals and their visual representation through computer graphics.
- **Purpose:** The purpose of this project was to create a tool for exploring and visualizing fractals, specifically the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set, using the MiniLibX library in C.

## Project Description
Fract'ol is a small fractal exploration program that offers the visualization of the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set. It allows users to zoom in and out of fractal images, create different Julia sets by passing parameters, and utilize colors to represent fractal depth.
